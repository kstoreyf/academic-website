    <img src="{{ '/images/headshot.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" align="left" width="280"> I'm Kate Storey-Fisher (she/her), a Kavli Fellow at the <a href="https://kipac.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology</a> (KIPAC) at Stanford. I am in <a href="https://www.risawechsler.com/gfc-group.html" target="_blank">Prof. Risa Wechsler's Galaxy Formation & Cosmology group</a>, and will also collaborate with researchers across KIPAC and the university. Previously I was a postdoc at the <a href="https://dipc.ehu.eus/es" target="_blank">Donostia International Physics Center</a> (DIPC) in Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain, working with Prof. Raúl Angulo. I completed my PhD advised by Prof. David W. Hogg at the <a href="https://cosmo.nyu.edu" target="_blank">Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics</a> at New York University where I was a NASA FINESST fellow.

    I study the large-scale structure of the universe—how we can use observations of galaxies and other astronomical objects to understand fundamental cosmological properties. More broadly, I’m interested in the application of data science and statistics to astrophysical problems.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am also a writer, a public science educator, an open source advocate, a labor organizer, a half-marathoner, a cyclist (for commuting and for fun), and a vocal proponent of getting enough sleep.
