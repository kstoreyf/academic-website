    <p> <img src="{{ '/images/headshot.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" align="left" width="200"> I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://cosmo.nyu.edu" target="_blank">Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics</a> at New York University and a NASA FINESST fellow. I study the large-scale structure of the universe—how we can use observations of galaxies and other astronomical objects to understand fundamental cosmological properties. More broadly, I’m interested in the application of data science and statistics to astrophysical problems.

    I am also a writer, a public science educator, a cool TA (not a regular TA), an open source advocate, a labor organizer, a half-marathoner, and an extremely dedicated member of my book club.</p>
