I write for [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org), a site by graduate students that summarizes new astrophysics research papers and dishes out other astro-focused content. Some of my recent posts are below.

Iâ€™ve also published in the Cooper Square Review; check out my [book review of "Hello World"](http://coopersquarereview.org/review/the-algorithms-that-rule-your-life/) by Hannah Fry.
