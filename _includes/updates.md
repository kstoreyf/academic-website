- **February 2023**: I accepted postdoctoral positions at the [Donostia International Physics Center](http://dipc.ehu.es/){:target="\_blank"} with Prof. Raúl Angulo and as a Kavli Fellow at [Stanford KIPAC](https://kipac.stanford.edu/){:target="\_blank"}! I'm so grateful for everyone who supported me throughout job season.
- **February 2023**: I attended the [BASP (Biomedical and Astrophysical Signal Processing) Frontiers 2023](https://baspfrontiers.org/){:target="\_blank"} in Villars-sur-Ollon, Switzerland, and won a [best contribution award](https://baspfrontiers.org/best-contribution-awards/){:target="\_blank"} for my [talk](https://tinyurl.com/ksf-BASP2023){:target="\_blank"} on equivariant machine learning for cosmological simulations!
