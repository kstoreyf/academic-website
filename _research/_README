- Start files with an underscore to ignore them.
- The descriptions all need to be the same length (number of lines on rendered page), or else the layout gets messed up! TODO fix, but I think it'll be an annoying CSS thing...
- For some reason when I typed the phrase "spoiler:" in a description, it wouldn't render. The colon was fine elsewhere tho??
