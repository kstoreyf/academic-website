title: Anomalous Galaxies with GANs
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02434
description: I applied Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect anomalous images in the Hyper-Suprime Cam survey. Along with a novel method for anomaly characterization with convolutional autoencoders, we found galaxy mergers, tidal features, extreme star-formers, and even some unexplainable objects. Read about it <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02434">here</a>, and find more <a href="https://weirdgalaxi.es">https://weirdgalaxi.es</a> yourself!
