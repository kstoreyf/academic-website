title: Continuous 2-Point Function Estimation
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01836
description: I developed a new estimator for galaxy clustering that is <em>continuous</em> in galaxy separation, and any other property (binning is sinning!). It is a generalization of the 2-point correlation function using least-squares fitting. Check out the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01836">paper</a> and the code, <a href="https://suave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">suave</a>. My collaborator Abby Williams is using it to measure <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AAS...23811601W/abstract">horizon-scale gradients</a>.
