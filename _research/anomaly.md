title: Anomaly Detection with GANs
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02434
description: I applied Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect anomalous images in the Hyper-Suprime Cam survey. We found galaxy mergers, tidal features, and extreme star-formers, and even some unexplained images. Find more weird galaxies yourself <a href="https://weirdgalaxi.es">here</a>.
