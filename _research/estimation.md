title: Continuous 2-Point Function Estimation
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01836
description: I constructed a generalization of the estimator for the 2-point correlation function for large-scale structure. It measures galaxy clustering in a continuous basis, without bins (binning is sinning!). Check out the code, <a href="https://suave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">suave</a>.
