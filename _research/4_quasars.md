title: Quaia, the Gaia-unWISE Quasar Catalog
link: https://cosmo.nyu.edu/ksf/quaia.mp4
description: The <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia">Gaia</a> Milky Way mission incidentally observed 6.6 million quasar candidates! I worked with a team of collaborators to use this sample to contruct a quasar catalog for large-scale structure cosmology, dubbed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17749">Quaia</a>. Check out our first cosmological result with Quaia, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17748">cross-correlation analysis</a> with CMB lensing. More results to come! And check out this <a href="https://cosmo.nyu.edu/ksf/quaia.mp4">nifty animation</a>.
