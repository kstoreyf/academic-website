description: The <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia">Gaia</a> Milky Way mission incidentally observed 6.6 million quasar candidates! I am working with a team of collaborators to produce a quasar catalog for large-scale structure cosmology. We are improving the redshift estimates and modelling the selection funciton, and starting to make some cosmological measurements---stay tuned!
