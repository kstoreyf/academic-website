title: SBI for Galaxy Clustering
description: With the BACCO group at DIPC, I am generating a library of mock galaxy catalogs for simulation-based inference (SBI) for galaxy clustering. We are using the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04594" target="_blank">map2map</a> full-field emulator and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06437" target="_blank">hybrid bias expansion</a> to model galaxy bias, which we will marginalize over to infer cosmology. The goal is to quantify the information in the galaxy field; stay tuned!
