title: Full-field galaxy clustering inference
description: I am working on generating a library of mock galaxy catalogs with the aim of performing full-field inference on the galaxy distribution, along with the BACCO group at DIPC. We are using the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04594" target="_blank">map2map</a> emulator and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06437" target="_blank">hybrid bias expansion</a> for the library, and experimenting with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05991" target="_blank">moment networks</a> for the inference. Stay tuned!
