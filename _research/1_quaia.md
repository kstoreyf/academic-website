title: The Quaia Quasar Catalog
link: https://cosmo.nyu.edu/ksf/quaia.mp4
description: The <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia">Gaia</a> mission incidentally observed 6.6 million quasar candidates! Combining this with WISE data, we contructed a quasar catalog for large-scale structure cosmology, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17749">Quaia</a>. Check out our analyses with Quaia, including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17748">measuring S8</a> and the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24134">matter-radiation equality scale</a> in cross-correlation with CMB lensing. And check out this <a href="https://cosmo.nyu.edu/ksf/quaia.mp4">nifty animation</a>.
