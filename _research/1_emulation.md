title: Emulation of Clustering Statistics
link: https://aemulusproject.github.io/index.html
description: With the <a href="https://aemulusproject.github.io/index.html">Aemulus collaboration</a>, I aim to tap into the cosmological constraining power at small scales. We use Gaussian process <em>emulators</em> to model galaxy clustering statistics; we recently performed an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08999">analysis of the BOSS galaxy survey</a>. I am currently emulating beyond-standard statistics to further constrain the growth of structure.
