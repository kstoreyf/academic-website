title: Emulation of Clustering Statistics
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03203
description: With the <a href="https://aemulusproject.github.io/index.html">Aemulus collaboration</a>, I aim to tap into the cosmological constraining power at small scales. We use Gaussian process <em>emulators</em> to model galaxy clustering statistics. I investigated emulating beyond-standard statistics to further constrain the growth of structure (spoiler, we get more precise constraints!) Check out our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03203">paper</a>.
