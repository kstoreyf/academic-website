title: Emulation of Clustering Statistics
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03203
description: With the <a href="https://aemulusproject.github.io/index.html">Aemulus collaboration</a>, I have developed Gaussian process <em>emulators</em> to model galaxy clustering statistics in order to extract small-scale information. I investigated emulating beyond-standard statistics, such as the marked correlation function, to further constrain the growth of structure (spoiler, we get more precise constraints!). Check out our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03203">paper</a>.
