title: Equivariant ML for Cosmology

description: My collaborators have developed a new approach for enforcing physical symmetries in machine learning tasks by constructing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06610">invariant scalars</a> from geometric objects, which greatly <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03761">improves performance</a>. We are currently applying the approach to DM halos in cosmological simulations to learn their relationship to galaxy properties.
